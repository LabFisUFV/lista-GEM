## Describe the steps applied to generate the model

1. Check if any annotations are available (ex. NCBI, JGI)
2. Describe annotation
3. Get template model: iYali (https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Yarrowia_lipolytica_W29-GEM)
4. Get genome annotation utilized in iYali reconstruction
5. Ajust reconstruction protocol 
6. Model from homoloy with Yarrowia_lipolytica_W29-GEM
7. Model from homoloy with rhto-GEM




6. Generate first draft of the model from homology
7. Curate exch rxns
